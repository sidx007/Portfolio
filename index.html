  <div class="dim-con">
    <p>Hello! I'm Siddharth Sharma, currently based in Mohali. I am a first-year student at Thapar Institute of Engineering and Technology, pursuing a degree in B.Tech Computer Engineering, with an expected graduation year of 2027.

      My academic journey is fueled by a deep passion for programming. I am proficient in languages like Python and C++, and I'm currently delving into the fascinating realms of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. The potential to create intelligent systems and solve complex problems using technology truly excites me.
      
      Beyond the world of code, you'll often find me immersed in the pages of non-fiction and philosophical books. I believe in the power of continuous learning and find inspiration in exploring diverse perspectives through literature.
      
      As I navigate through my academic and personal pursuits, I look forward to embracing challenges, honing my skills, and contributing meaningfully to the ever-evolving field of technology.
      
      Let's connect and share our journeys! Feel free to reach out if you share similar interests or if you have any intriguing ideas to discuss.
