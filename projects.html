        <h3>Virtual assistant in python</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="dim-con">
        <p>In my 10th-grade year, I developed a Virtual Assistant for PC using Python, integrating Google's Natural Language Processing (NLP) library for audio input. Even though it was a simple python script, the program boasted several standout features, setting it apart from similar projects found on YouTube. Users could perform tasks like sending emails, attaching files, playing music, and launching applications, making it a highly versatile and productive tool.</p>
